## Challenge
  In this challenge, I was tasked with finding key statistical data for the month of June and December. Through my analysis I found that there was not as much of a difference than I initially anticipated. The average temperature in the month of June was 74 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.25. The month of December had an average temperature of 71 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.74. The two months had relatively close average temperatures with that standard deviation almost covering the difference between the averages. This suggests that the temperature in Hawaii does not fluctuate very much during the year, but more analysis on the other months would give a more definitive answer. However, minimum temperature between the months are different: with December having a low of 56 and June a low of 64.
  
  A difference can be more easily seen when one looks at the average temperature per station between the two months. It is clear that the average temperature at each station are higher in June compared to December. I would suggest that the average temperature for each station for each month is plotted on a graph so that one can see how the temperature changes throughout the year. It would also be interesting to look at the average precipitation each station gets over the year and the relationship between the amount of precipitation and the temperature at each station.
